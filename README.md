# WARBLER

Warbler is a microblogging app where users can post short entries, like posts, and follow other users. The app is built with a Python/Flask backend that renders
Jinja templates and a PostgreSQL database. THe purpose of this project is to create an app that's similar to Twitter, which then allows me to learn RESTful design
in the process.
